/*🧮 Problem Title: The Farmer’s Fencing Problem
💡 Problem Story:
A farmer named Raju owns a rectangular piece of land.
He wants to build a fence around it and also plant crops inside the land.

To plan the fencing and crop area, he needs to calculate:

The area of the rectangle (for crops).

The perimeter of the rectangle (for fencing).

He knows the length and width of the land in meters.
Can you help Raju write a program to find both the area and perimeter of his land?

🧠 Task:
Write a program that takes two integers as input — the length and width of the rectangle —
and prints the area and perimeter.

📥 Input Format:
The first line contains two integers,
length and width — dimensions of the rectangle.

📤 Output Format:
Print two lines:

First line: "Area = <value>"

Second line: "Perimeter = <value>"*/


#include<stdio.h>
int main ()  {

    float length , width , area , perimeter ;


    printf("Enter the length of the rectangular field: ") ;
    scanf("%f",&length) ;

    printf("Enter the width of the rectangilar field : ") ;
    scanf("%f",&width) ;

    area = length* width ;
    perimeter = 2*(width+length) ; 

    printf("THE AREA OF THE FIELD : %.2f  \n",area) ;
    printf("THE PERiMETER OF THE FIELD : %.2f \n ",perimeter) ;

    return 0 ;
